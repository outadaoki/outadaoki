### Preface

```

Tips:
    1. It is recommended to use Typora to open the .md file for a better viewing experience.
    2. If you do open this file intending to take a look, please be sure to read every single word carefully and not waste the author's effort.
    3. This is likely the last piece of material I can leave for my younger schoolmates. I will try my best to share my entire journey of learning OI (Olympiad in Informatics) and the experiences I've gained along the way.

###### "Spreading Ideas"

> PS: This section is mainly used to convey some conceptual issues, hoping to be helpful to you.

1.
> Be the self you want to be, become the you that you aspire to be, and don't let yourself regret it.

2.
> We might as well compare our development to cooking. Teachers and parents are the chefs. Of course, like a pressure cooker, too much pressure will make it explode. It's nothing to be ashamed of to release pressure appropriately.

3.
> Even if you have ambitions, don't pursue anything excessively. Family health and living a happy life are more important than anything else, because everything you do is preparation for future happiness.

### Learning Journey

###### Self-Introduction

My name is Wang Zhongxing, often self-styled as outadaoki (~~actually I have an English name, Mortal·Yui, meaning even if one is mortal, they are the only existence among mortals~~). I was born in a rural village in Weifang, Shandong. I'm an anime otaku, game otaku, and tech otaku. As of 2025, I am a high school student. I have briefly dabbled in numerous programming languages, researched computer hardware, software, and hackintosh, among other things. I started learning OI in 2022. (~~I believe I have suffered from relatively severe depression~~).

###### First Encounter

I entered the Fangzi District Bowen Modern School in 2022. Before October, I was always full of passion for computers, loved researching, and often spent a whole day on it. In October, by coincidence, and amidst a teacher's disapproval and distrust which nearly prevented my registration, I lived up to "expectations" and failed the school's preliminary test. Later, thanks to Teacher Zhou's persistence, I was recommended for the district-level test. Luck and gratitude filled my mind. Then I did quite well in the district test (~~I suppose~~), and coincidentally, I was admitted to the Turing Class, where I first learned about the Olympiad in Informatics. What I loved, fortunately.

So, I hope everyone doesn't study blindly. If you truly love it, genuinely like it from the bottom of your heart, talent isn't that important because you will have the confidence to persevere. I hope everyone acts according to their capability and chooses the Olympiad that suits them.

Of course, learning an Olympiad is just one choice. If it's for the Gaokao, it's still advised to prioritize cultural subjects. However, those with ability can learn an Olympiad during the less stressful years and achieve results. I believe national policies won't let you down.

###### Foundation

In the following year or more of learning OI, I studied successively under Teacher Wang, Teacher Yu, Teacher Zheng, and Teacher Gao. During this period, I remained active in the field I loved, laying a solid foundation in syntax and basic algorithms. It can be said that the foundation laid during this stage greatly facilitated subsequent algorithm learning. I am also grateful for the cultivation from the entire Weifang No.4 High School Informatics Olympiad team.

Practice during this stage is essential. Just familiarize yourself with the C++ language. I don't need to give much guidance here; the entire team will provide you with the most effective help in this regard.

###### Advancement

In my third year of junior high, I entered Weifang No.4 High School, chose the Informatics Olympiad, and continued with advanced algorithm learning.

I personally believe this stage is the easiest to be hindered. After learning the basic algorithms, it's not recommended to specifically consolidate them. Instead, continue learning new topics. Because most subsequent problems won't test a single advanced algorithm in isolation, using challenging problems to learn new algorithms while consolidating old ones can achieve twice the result with half the effort. At this stage, you can learn data structures, such as ST tables, Trie, segment trees, etc., which are helpful for later algorithms. At the same time, you must train your own thinking. Every bit of time and space optimized in the later stages of algorithm competitions might involve a complete overhaul and reconstruction of the entire thought process and code. Always keep your thinking clear and be good at finding a point in your思路 to切入 and optimize.

###### Recently

To be honest, I haven't learned many new things this summer. Going out for training was also about expanding and improving upon algorithms I had already learned, such as the neighboring item exchange method in greedy algorithms, various types of DP, etc. But doing a few more problems in its intense learning environment is undoubtedly a form of improvement.

### Looking to the Future

After all, this article is written on the eve of the preliminary round for the future. I also want to talk about my long-term goals, which can serve as a reference for everyone.

| Competition | Goal | Level of Importance Required |
| :-------: | :----: | :----: |
| CSP-S Round 1 | Pass | **Extremely Important, only one chance** |
| CSP-S Round 2 | Pass | **A reference-significant contest, moderate importance** |
| NOIP | First Prize | **The final dream destination for most OI students** |

Let's not talk about the preliminary round scores for now; discussing scores without considering the number of participants is just nonsense.

NOIP scores are relatively stable, so we can talk about them. There are four problems in total. According to the current trend, the distribution is as follows:

| Problem (Rearranged by Difficulty) | Problem Difficulty | Expected Score |
| :----: | :----: | :----: |
| T1 | Popularity/Improvement- to Improvement+/Provincial Selection- | 100 |
| T2 | Popularity+/Improvement to Improvement+/Provincial Selection- | 40-60 |
| T3 | Provincial Selection and above | 20 |
| T4 | Provincial Selection and above | 20 |

### Postscript

Having written this far, many things have not been explained or are not fully explained. Please feel free to add me on QQ (see the end of the Preface section) for details. I hope I can help everyone, at least letting me be of some value after I retire (*Fun fact: I call myself 'outadaoki', which is the Romanized representation of the Japanese pronunciation for '王忠興', Hiragana is "おうたどあき"*).

Attached [**Study Notes**](https://www.luogu.com.cn/paste/wy1ny06v). They are all knowledge points for the Popularization Group. If the Luogu paste cannot be viewed, you can use a VPN. If you don't know how, I believe your passionate self would be willing to learn. I provide a method; there is a tutorial related to accelerators in the installation package folder of the Weiyun Chang Zhibo directory. You can also research it yourself. The technology we've played with might become outdated, but you can be active in the software and hardware circles. I believe you can do it.

Finally, students, your journey has just begun. As the header image says, this is the starting point of all miracles.
